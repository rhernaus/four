# Everything is FOUR

A fun web app demonstrating the "four is cosmic" theory in multiple languages. Every word eventually leads to four when you count its letters and repeat.

## How It Works

1. Start with any word
2. Count the number of letters in the word
3. Write out that number as a word
4. Repeat steps 2-3 until you reach "four"

Example: `programming` → `eleven` → `six` → `three` → `five` → `four` → `four`
